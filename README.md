# DATA STRUCTURES

Data structures are one of the best entry points to true computer science:
  * They can be easily drawn, 'easily' coded, have nearly-intuitive behavior.
  * They are ubiquitous in daily programming.  Usually behind the scenes, but knowing what's back there can help a lot.  
 * You could write an entire dissertation on them and still not run out new things to learn.
 
By studying data structures you can at the same time keep your head above water, learn something useful, sharpen your coding skills, and dip your toes into some serious algorithmics.

### The Projects

We've selected some of the most basic and useful data structures for you to replicate.  Each one comes with empty code and a little bit of instruction. 

0. _Stack_: 
    * First in, last out.
1. _Queue_:
    * First in, First out.
2. _Linked List_:
    * Can only look forward in line.
3. _Doubly Linked List_:
    * Can look forward or backwards in line.
4. _Binary Search Tree_:
    * Always knows which way to turn.
5. _Complete Tree_: 
    * Very superficial. <- fix this

_**Extra Super Challenge**_:
* Study Loupe and replicate the JS runtime using custom data structures and a 'Javascript' class.
